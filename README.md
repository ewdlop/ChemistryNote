### **Molecular Spectrum**
The molecular spectrum involves studying the absorption, emission, or scattering of electromagnetic radiation by molecules. It's key in identifying molecular structure and composition.

#### **1. Types of Molecular Spectra**
1. **Rotational Spectra (Microwave Spectroscopy):**
   - Caused by rotational transitions in molecules.
   - Used to determine bond lengths and molecular geometry.

2. **Vibrational Spectra (Infrared Spectroscopy):**
   - Caused by vibrational transitions within molecules.
   - Identifies functional groups in molecules.

3. **Electronic Spectra (UV-Vis Spectroscopy):**
   - Caused by electronic transitions (e.g., π → π*).
   - Used for studying conjugated systems and electronic properties.

4. **Raman Spectra:**
   - Caused by inelastic scattering of light, providing vibrational information.

#### **2. Python Simulation of a Molecular Spectrum**
Below is a simple simulation of **vibrational transitions** using Gaussian peaks:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulate a vibrational spectrum
def simulate_spectrum(peaks, resolution=1000):
    """Generate a vibrational spectrum with Gaussian peaks."""
    wavelengths = np.linspace(400, 800, resolution)  # Range in nm
    spectrum = np.zeros_like(wavelengths)

    for peak, intensity in peaks:
        spectrum += intensity * np.exp(-0.5 * ((wavelengths - peak) / 10) ** 2)

    return wavelengths, spectrum

# Example peaks (wavelength in nm, intensity arbitrary units)
peaks = [(450, 1.0), (500, 0.8), (600, 0.6)]
wavelengths, spectrum = simulate_spectrum(peaks)

plt.plot(wavelengths, spectrum)
plt.title("Simulated Vibrational Spectrum")
plt.xlabel("Wavelength (nm)")
plt.ylabel("Intensity (a.u.)")
plt.show()
```

    return dose * (ka / (ka - ke)) * (np.exp(-ke * time) - np.exp(-ka * time))

# Parameters
dose = 500  # Dose in mg
ka = 1.2    # Absorption rate constant (1/h)
